# Portfolio-optimisation-using-python-and-pandas-
Portfolio optimization is a fundamental concept in finance, and it typically involves finding the optimal allocation of assets to maximize returns while minimizing risk. 

Here's a Python code example for a basic portfolio optimization using NumPy and the mean-variance optimization theory:


In this code:

   * We start by defining the expected returns of individual assets and the covariance matrix, which represents the relationships between asset returns.

   * We specify the number of assets and a risk-free rate, which is typically the yield of a risk-free security (e.g., Treasury bond).

   * We randomly initialize portfolio weights and ensure that they sum up to 1, representing the allocation of assets in the portfolio.

  *  We calculate the expected portfolio return, portfolio volatility (standard deviation), and the Sharpe ratio, which measures the risk-adjusted return of the portfolio.

This code provides a basic example of portfolio optimization using mean-variance analysis. In practice, more advanced techniques and constraints may be considered, and you may use optimization libraries like scipy.optimize to find the optimal weights.
